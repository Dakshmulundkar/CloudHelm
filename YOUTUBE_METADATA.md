## Description:

Welcome to CloudHelm, an intelligent cloud operations platform that helps you monitor costs, track incidents, manage releases, and optimize your infrastructure across AWS, Google Cloud Platform, and Azure.

In this complete walkthrough, I'll show you every feature of CloudHelm including real-time cost monitoring, AI-powered anomaly detection, resource optimization recommendations, application health tracking, incident management, and our Mistral AI-powered DevOps assistant.

CloudHelm is built with modern technologies including React, TypeScript, FastAPI, Python, and PostgreSQL. It integrates with GitHub for release tracking and uses Mistral AI and Gemini AI for intelligent insights and automation.

Whether you're a DevOps engineer, cloud architect, SRE team member, or managing cloud infrastructure for your startup, CloudHelm provides a unified dashboard to reduce costs, prevent incidents, and make data-driven decisions about your cloud resources.

The platform features real-time monitoring across multiple cloud providers, AI-powered cost anomaly detection, resource rightsizing recommendations, application performance metrics, incident tracking with AI-generated summaries, GitHub integration for deployment tracking, and an AI assistant that can analyze your infrastructure and provide intelligent recommendations.

Key benefits include reducing cloud costs by 20-30% through waste identification and optimization, faster incident detection and resolution with real-time monitoring, better visibility into resource utilization across all your cloud providers, and data-driven infrastructure decisions powered by AI insights.
